# JS-minigames
Small project to refresh JavaScript syntax and learn how to create games using JS - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc

Memory game bugs
* remove card after chosen so that theycan't be picked again (currently turning it white and can still be flipped over)

Whack-a-mole bugs
* hitting the mole multiple times adds multiple points (need to make only hit once)
